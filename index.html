            <h1>Deaths in Car Crashes</h1>
            <p>The amount of death during car crashes can be considered to be very high <br>
                However it can also be said that we are improving as drivers
            </p>
            <div id="chart_div"></div>
            <p>This is very evident especially since in the chart above you can see that<br>
                within the past 6 years the amount of deaths in car accidents<br>
                have decreased significantly.
